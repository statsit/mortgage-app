# Mortgage App
The app calculates the amount of the monthly payment for a mortgage loan. The user can specify the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the number of years, and the date of the first payment. The app will then calculate the amount of the monthly payment.

## Usage
```bash
1. Provide date. Default to current date if not provided
2. provide your monthly payment amount. e.g 2300


```bash
python3 main.py --amount=2300 
```
